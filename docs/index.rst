Hacking the WordPress
==========================

WordPress is a free and open-source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL [`wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress>`_].
It is very popular because it is easy to use and deploy on the Internet. On the other hand, it has a lot of security threats.
In this document, I would like to show you how the hacker steals the information from your WordPress website 
and attack it. Then, I want to suggest the way to pretect your system from the attack.

To attack the system without permission is against law. So I installed the target testing system on docker in my laptop.
It is very fast and easy to manage your testing WordPress website. You can take advantage of docker as well.
